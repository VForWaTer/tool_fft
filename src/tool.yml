    title: Discrete Fast Fourier Transformation
    description: | 
      Perform a discrete fast Fourier transformation on numerical data. The data is accepted as a single-column
      dat file, or as a CSV file. The tool will automatically ignore all non-numeric columns.
      Note that the functions implemented here were almost entirely written by chatGPT as a test. 
      All produced functions needed some human refactoring to get inputs and outputs right.
